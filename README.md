# todo-django-materialize
To-do app built with Django and Materialize CSS.

I'm learning Django so there are class based views and function based views.
<br>
Will add VueJS to reduce number of pages eg. delete page.

## Help is appreciated:
Bugs:
<ul>
  <li>Completed button doesn't show on update page.</li>
  <li>Doesn't accept input if Materialize CSS Datepicker is used.</li>
  <li>Materialize CSS not fully funcitonal on update page.</li>
</ul>
<br>

TODO:
<ul>
  <li>Add sort by due date</li>
  <li>Add tests</li>
<ul>
